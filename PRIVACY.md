KATSEYE Privacy Policy

Last Updated: November 10, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how KATSEYE (“the Bot”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles data when users interact with it on Discord.
By using KATSEYE, you agree to this policy. If you disagree, please do not use the Bot.

1. Information We Collect

KATSEYE collects only the minimum data required for its functionality and user experience.
This may include:

Discord User IDs and Server IDs – to recognize users and servers for settings and moderation.

Channel IDs or Message IDs – only when needed for command responses or moderation logs.

Configuration Data – such as custom bot settings, preferences, or roles you assign to the bot.

Command Usage Logs – may be temporarily stored to track errors or prevent abuse.

We do not collect:

Real names

Emails or passwords

Messages or content outside of bot commands

Payment or financial information

2. How We Use the Data

Collected data is used solely to provide and improve the bot’s functionality, such as:

Saving server settings or preferences

Enabling moderation and utility features

Detecting command misuse or bugs

Maintaining uptime and performance

Data is never sold, rented, or shared with any third parties.

3. Data Storage and Retention

Data is stored securely using standard practices.

Only essential data (like server configs) is stored persistently.

Temporary logs are deleted automatically after a short time.

If a server removes the bot, related data may be automatically purged after a cleanup period.

4. Data Sharing

Your data is not shared with:

Advertising platforms

Analytics companies

Third-party developers

However, the bot may use Discord’s official API, which is governed by Discord’s Privacy Policy
.

5. Your Rights

You have the right to:

Request data deletion (/delete-data or by contacting the developer)

Request a copy of your stored data

Stop using the bot at any time (removing the bot deletes your interaction with it)

Requests are handled within a reasonable timeframe.

6. Children’s Privacy

KATSEYE does not knowingly collect or store data from users under the age of 13 (or the minimum age in their country).
If we learn that such data exists, it will be deleted immediately.

7. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect stored information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.
However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

8. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time.
Updates will be reflected with a new “Last Updated” date.
Continued use of KATSEYE after changes means you accept the revised policy.
